# Speech Emotion Recognition
In this project I propose a possible solution to the Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) classification problem. In particular given a datset of audio files we had to implement a classifier to distinguish the different emotions expressed in the audio. The first part part of the project is about feature extraction and consist in splitting the audio signals into short-term windows called frames, extracting different features from each of them and then computing global statistics on the results. These global statistics are used in the second part as input for the classifier and so in the training and testing of the two different algorithm. The detail of the work and the final result are availabe in the [report](https://github.com/alessandrobonadeo/Speech-Emotion-Recognition/blob/main/Report.pdf).
